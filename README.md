Understanding trans-translation process in Leptospira interrogans

Leptospirosis, a neglected zoonotic disease caused by *Leptospira* spirochetes, affects over a million people annually, leading to 60,000 deaths. Humans contract the disease through contact with infected animal urine. In animals, it can cause reproductive issues, while in humans, it can escalate from flu-like symptoms to multi-organ failure. This study focuses on the trans-translation mechanism in *Leptospira interrogans* serovar Copenhageni Fiocruz L1-30. Specifically, it will examine the interaction between SmpB protein and tmRNA, which rescues stalled ribosomes and tags incomplete proteins for degradation.
